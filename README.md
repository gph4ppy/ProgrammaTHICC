# ProgrammaTHICC

ProgrammaTHICC is an app developed for learning programming languages.

__At this moment, it offers five languages:__
- C++
- C#
- Swift (to do)
- PHP (to do)
- JavaScript (to do)

# Informations:
- ProgrammaTHICC is currently created only on IOS devices (Swift, SwiftUI).
- It's not real app (for now) - just a project for portfolio.
- The project is ended, but probably I will add more things in the future.
- The app works on iPhone and iPad in:
    - portrait mode
    - landscape mode
    - upside-down mode

# Ideas:
- The first launch of the application opens a survey that will ask the user a few questions. Thanks to CoreML it will be possible to choose the best language for the user.
- Add multi-platform support (Mac, Watch).

# To Do:
- Write Swift, PHP and JavaScript tutorials.

# Tech:
- SwiftUI
- Firebase

The app has been tested on iPhone SE 2020, so because I typed some data in the password field, it has been hidden.
